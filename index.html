    <p>
      John Muir was born on April 21rst 1838 in Dunbar, Scottland. In 1849
      he moved with his family to the United States. He had a younger
      brother, with whow he enjoyed exploring the fields and the woods of
      the rich Wiscounsin countryside. Im 1860, he entered the University of
      Wisconsin. Three years later, he started traveling around the world.
      In 1867 he suffered an eye injury that had a large impact on his life.
      After recovering, he decided he would dedicate his life to the fields
      and woods. In March 1868 he landed in San Francisco and from that
      moment on California became his Home. He became truly attached to
      California's Sierra Nevada and Yosemite. In 1874 he launched a
      successful career as a writer. In 1880 he got married to Louie Wanda
      Strentzel, with whom he had two daughters. Through a series of
      articles published in Century magazine, Muir brought the attention to
      the devastation of mountains and forests. In 1890, with the help of
      Century's associate editor - Robert Underwood Johnson - an act of
      Congress created Yosemite National Park. Muir was also involved in the
      creation of Sequoia, Mount Rainier and Grand Canyon National Parks.
      For that reason, Muir is often called the "The Father of the National
      Parks". In 1892, Muir and supporters found the "Sierra Club". Muir
      served as the Club's president until his death in 1914.
